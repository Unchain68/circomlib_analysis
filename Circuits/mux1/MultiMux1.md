# How does it work

This code is a template code that creates a multiplexer that selects one of n input values ​​and outputs it. The multiplexer's input is given as c, an nx2 array, and the multiplexer's selection is given as s. The output is given as an array of length n called out.

In the for loop of the code, it iterates n times, and within the loop, out[i] is calculated, which is (c[i][1] - c[i][0]) * s + c[i][0 ]. This value is calculated in the following way:

When the value of s is 0, the value of out[i] becomes c[i][0].
When the value of s is 1, the value of out[i] becomes c[i][1].
Here, (c[i][1] - c[i][0]) is the difference between the two inputs, and multiplication by s separates the selected and unselected values. For example, if the value of s is 0 (c[i][1] - c[i][0]) * s becomes 0 and the value of c[i][0] is output, and if the value of s is 1 ( c[i][1] - c[i][0]) * s becomes c[i][1] - c[i][0], outputting the value c[i][1].

So this code provides the operations needed to implement a multiplexer.
